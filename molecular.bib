The results suggest that anharmonic treatments are essential for protein vibrational spectroscopy. The calculation uses the vibrational self-consistent field approximation, which includes anharmonicity and interaction among modes in a mean-field sense.

abstract = {Abstract.\&nbsp;\&nbsp; Quantum molecular dynamics describes the time-evolution of a chemical system at the atomic level by directly solving the
  Schr�dinger equation. Time-dependent methods, exemplified by wavepacket propagation, are by now developed to a point where
  they provide an important insight into the mechanism of many fundamental processes. Of these methods, the most versatile and
  efficient is probably the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method. The form of the wavefunction used leads
  to a particularly compact description of the system, and it is possible to run either qualitative, cheap, or accurate, expensive
  calculations within the same framework. MCTDH has now shown that it is able to treat systems much larger than other wavepacket
  propagation methods, and benchmark calculations on systems with up to 24 degrees of freedom have been made. In contrast, standard
  methods can rarely treat more than 4–6 degrees of freedom. In the following, we review the basic theory of MCTDH. Recent advances
  are included, such as the development of the method for treating the time-evolution of density operators.},

abstract = {Ab initio calculations on the six-dimensional cis--trans double minimum potential energy surface of the electronic ground state of the HONO molecule were performed using a coupled cluster approach. An analytic fit to the data points was established. The interconversion barrier was calculated to be 4105 cm(-1). The nuclear motion problem was solved variationally using a full six-dimensional Hamiltonian in internal coordinates. The eigenstates up to about 3650 cm(-1) were tentatively assigned by harmonic quantum numbers. The assignment was based on the mean values of the internal coordinates of the six-dimensional eigenfunctions and on a comparison of the eigenenergies with those calculated by second-order perturbation theory from a full quartic force field in dimensionless normal coordinates. In cold matrices the trans- and the cis-OH nu(1) stretching modes and the first trans- and cis-NO 2nu(2) stretching overtones lead to isomerization. In the isolated molecule these modes (J=0) were found to be entirely localized. However, several overtones of the nu(4) ONO bending and nu(5) N-O stretching, which are close in energy to the OH stretch and combined with the torsional mode, were found to be strongly cis-trans delocalized.},

Tens of thousands of coupled-cluster [CCSD(T)] and second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) calculations of electronic energies, using aug-cc-pVTZ basis, were done. The energies were fit very precisely in terms of all the internuclear distances, using standard least-square procedures, however, with a fitting basis that satisfies permutational symmetry with respect to like atoms. The H(5)O(2) (+) PES is a fit to 48 189 CCSD(T) energies, containing 7962 polynomial coefficients. The PES has a rms fitting error of 34.9 cm(-1) for the entire data set up to 110 000 cm(-1). This surface can describe various internal floppy motions, including the H atom exchanges, monomer inversions, and monomer torsions. First- and higher-order saddle points have been located on the surface and compared with available previous theoretical work. In addition, the PES dissociates correctly (and symmetrically) to H(2)O+H(3)O(+), with D(e)=11 923.8 cm(-1). Geometrical and vibrational properties of the monomer fragments are presented. The corresponding global DMS fit (MP2 based) involves 3844 polynomial coefficients and also dissociates correctly.},

The dynamics is described by curvilinear coordinates. The expression of the kinetic energy operator in this set of coordinates is given and its derivation, following the polyspherical method, is discussed. The potential-energy surface (PES) employed is that of Huang et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 122, 044308 (2005)]. A scheme for the representation of the PES is discussed which is based on a high-dimensional model representation scheme, but modified to take advantage of the mode-combination representation of the vibrational wave function used in MCTDH. The convergence of the PES expansion used is quantified and evidence is provided that it correctly reproduces the reference PES at least for the range of energies of interest. The reported zero point energy of the system is converged with respect to the MCTDH expansion and in excellent agreement (16.7 cm(-1) below) with the diffusion Monte Carlo result on the PES of Huang et al. The highly fluxional nature of the cation is accounted for through use of curvilinear coordinates. The system is found to interconvert between equivalent minima through wagging and internal rotation motions already when in the ground vibrational state, i.e., T=0. It is shown that a converged quantum-dynamical description of such a flexible, multiminima system is possible.},

The calculations are performed using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method for propagation of wavepackets. All the fundamentals and several overtones of the vibrational motion are computed. The spectrum of H5O2+ is shaped to a large extent by couplings of the proton-transfer motion to large amplitude fluxional motions of the water molecules, water bending and water-water stretch motions. These couplings are identified and discussed, and the corresponding spectral lines are assigned. The large couplings featured by H5O2+ do not hinder, however, to describe the coupled vibrational motion by well defined simple types of vibration (stretching, bending; etc.) based on well defined modes of vibration, in terms of which the spectral lines are assigned. Comparison of our results to recent experiments and calculations on the system is given. The reported MCTDH IR spectrum is in very good agreement to the recently measured spectrum by Hammer et al.

abstract = {The multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) approach facilitates multidimensional quantum dynamics calculations by representing the wavepacket in an optimal set of time-dependent basis functions, called single-particle functions. Choosing these single-particle functions to be themselves multidimensional wavefunctions which are represented using a MCTDH representation, a multilayer MCTDH scheme has been constructed and used for quantum dynamics calculations treating up to 1000 degrees of freedom rigorously [Wang and Thoss, J. Chem. Phys. 199, 1289 (2003)]. The present work gives a practical scheme which facilitates the application of the multilayer MCTDH approach, which previously has only been employed to study systems described by model-type Hamiltonians, to molecular systems described by more complicated Hamiltonians and general potential energy surfaces. A multilayer extension of the correlation discrete variable representation (CDVR) scheme employed in MCTDH calculations studying quantum dynamics on general potential energy surfaces is developed and tested in a simple numerical application. The resulting multilayer MCTDH/CDVR approach might offer a perspective to rigorously describe the quantum dynamics of larger polyatomic systems.},
