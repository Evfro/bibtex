abstract = {When an algorithm in dimension one is extended to dimension d, in nearly every case its computational cost is taken to the power d. This fundamental difficulty is the single greatest impediment to solving many important problems and has been dubbed the curse of dimensionality. For numerical analysis in dimension d, we propose to use a representation for vectors and matrices that generalizes separation of variables while allowing controlled accuracy. Basic linear algebra operations can be performed in this representation using one-dimensional operations, thus bypassing the exponential scaling with respect to the dimension. Although not all operators and algorithms may be compatible with this representation, we believe that many of the most important ones are. We prove that the multiparticle Schr\"{o}dinger operator, as well as the inverse Laplacian, can be represented very efficiently in this form. We give numerical evidence to support the conjecture that eigenfunctions inherit this property by computing the ground-state eigenfunction for a simplified Schr\"{o}dinger operator with 30 particles. We conjecture and provide numerical evidence that functions of operators inherit this property, in which case numerical operator calculus in higher dimensions becomes feasible.},

abstract = {Tensor product decompositions with optimal separation rank provide an interesting alternative to traditional Gaussian-type basis functions in electronic structure calculations. We discuss various applications for a new compression algorithm, based on the Newton method, which provides for a given tensor the optimal tensor product or so-called best separable approximation for fixed Kronecker rank. In combination with a stable quadrature scheme for the Coulomb interaction, tensor product formats enable an efficient evaluation of Coulomb integrals. This is demonstrated by means of best separable approximations for the electron density and Hartree potential of small molecules, where individual components of the tensor product can be efficiently represented in a wavelet basis. We present a fairly detailed numerical analysis, which provides the basis for further improvements of this novel approach. Our results suggest a broad range of applications within density fitting schemes, which have been recently successfully applied in quantum chemistry.},

  extensions to 3D Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF) that are robust in the presence of noise and have many potential applications,
  including multi-way Blind Source Separation (BSS), multi-sensory or multi-dimensional data analysis, and nonnegative neural
  sparse coding. We propose to use local cost functions whose simultaneous or sequential (one by one) minimization leads to
  a very simple ALS algorithm which works under some sparsity constraints both for an under-determined (a system which has less
  sensors than sources) and over-determined model. The extensive experimental results confirm the validity and high performance

abstract = {Inthis paper, we describe and analyze a novel tensor approximationmethod for discretized multidimensional functions and operators in \$\backslash mathbb\{R\}\^{}d\$, basedon the idea of multigrid acceleration. The approach stands onsuccessive reiterations of the orthogonal Tucker tensor approximation on asequence of nested refined grids. On the one hand, itprovides a good initial guess for the nonlinear iterations tofind the approximating subspaces on finer grids; on the otherhand, it allows us to transfer from the coarse-to-fine gridsthe important data structure information on the location of theso-called most important fibers in directional unfolding matrices. The methodindicates linear complexity with respect to the size of datarepresenting the input tensor. In particular, if the target tensoris given by using the rank-\$R\$ canonical model, then ourapproximation method is proved to have linear scaling in theunivariate grid size \$n\$ and in the input rank \$R\$.The method is tested by three-dimensional (3D) electronic structure calculations.For the multigrid accelerated low Tucker-rank approximation of the allelectron densities having strong nuclear cusps, we obtain high resolutionof their 3D convolution product with the Newton potential. Theaccuracy of order \$10\^{}\{-6\}\$ in max-norm is achieved on large\$n\backslash times n\backslash times n\$ grids up to \$n=1.6\backslash cdot10\^{}4\$, with the timescale in several minutes.

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This paper investigates best rank-(r
  1,..., r
  
  d
  ) Tucker tensor approximation of higher-order tensors arising from the discretization of linear operators and functions in
  ℝ
  d
  . Super-convergence of the best rank-(r
  1,..., r
  
  d
  ) Tucker-type decomposition with respect to the relative Frobenius norm is proven. Dimensionality reduction by the two-level
  Tucker-to-canonical approximation is discussed. Tensor-product representation of basic multi-linear algebra operations is
  considered, including inner, outer and Hadamard products. Furthermore, we focus on fast convolution of higher-order tensors
  represented by the Tucker/canonical models. Optimized versions of the orthogonal alternating least-squares (ALS) algorithm
  is presented taking into account the different formats of input data. We propose and test numerically the mixed CT-model, which is based on the additive splitting of a tensor as a sum of canonical and Tucker-type representations. It allows to
  stabilize the ALS iteration in the case of “ill-conditioned” tensors. The best rank-(r
  1,..., r
  
  d
  ) Tucker decomposition is applied to 3D tensors generated by classical potentials, for example 
  \$\$$\backslash$tfrac\{1\}\{\{$\backslash$left| \{x - y\} $\backslash$right|\}\}, e\^{}\{ - $\backslash$alpha $\backslash$left| \{x - y\} $\backslash$right|\} , $\backslash$tfrac\{\{e\^{}\{ - $\backslash$left| \{x - y\} $\backslash$right|\} \}\}\{\{$\backslash$left| \{x - y\} $\backslash$right|\}\}\$\$
  and 
  \$\$$\backslash$tfrac\{\{erf(|x|)\}\}\{\{|x|\}\}\$\$
  with x, y ∈ ℝ
  d
  . Numerical results for tri-linear decompositions illustrate exponential convergence in the Tucker rank, and robustness of
  the orthogonal ALS iteration.},

This is an extension of our previous work on the use of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for EEG classification. Numerical experiments with two data sets in BCI competition, confirm the useful behavior of the method for continuous EEG classification.},

It has been shown there that the solutions of this equation are surprisingly smooth and possess square integrable mixed weak derivatives of order up to N+1 with N the number of electrons across the singularities of the interaction potentials, and it has been claimed that this result can help to break the complexity barriers in computational quantum mechanics using correspondingly antisymmetrized sparse grid trial functions. A construction of this kind that can be interpreted as a sparse grid sampling theorem is sketched here.},
